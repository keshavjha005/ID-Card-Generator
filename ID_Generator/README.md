Title: Web Application for Generating ID Cards

Description:
This project is a web application developed using PHP, HTML, and CSS that allows users to create personalized ID cards by providing their information. 
The application offers a simple and user-friendly interface where users can enter their details, and the system generates an ID card with the provided information.

Features:
1. User Input: The application prompts users to enter their essential details, such as full name, designation, company name, ID number,
   date of birth, email, mobile number, and an optional profile picture URL.

2. ID Card Generation: Upon submitting the user's information, the application dynamically generates an ID card based on the provided data.
    The ID card includes the user's name, designation, company name, ID number, date of birth, contact information, and optionally displays the user's profile picture.

3. Validation: The application ensures that all mandatory fields are filled, and the provided data is validated to avoid any errors during ID card generation.

4. User Interaction: Users can access the web application through the browser and start generating their ID cards by filling out the form.

5. ID Card Generation: After submitting the form, the system processes the data and generates the ID card, displaying it on the same page.
